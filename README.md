# patronusAPI

Much of the code was take from Sian Culligan's hp_house api on github. 

Inspiration for the patronuses and characters was pulled from:

https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/what-is-a-patronus
 
 and 

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_characters

and creative liberties were taken.
